# Samuel Log Jackson


[![CI](https://github.com/lob/samuel_log_jackson/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/lob/samuel_log_jackson/actions/workflows/main.yml) ![Version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/samuel_log_jackson)

A tribute to one of the greatest actors of this generation. Whether you saw
him as Odell in "Jackie Brown", Private Henson in "A Soldier's Story", or 
as Nick Fury in the Marvel movies, we can all agree that Sam Jackson brings
a certain energy to the screen. 

And now you can have that same energy in the console. 

```js
import Samuel from samuel_log_jackson
Samuel.log.jackson("my error", Samuel.ERROR)
```

Which will output the following: 
`I'm sick and tired of these MFing errors in this MFing program: my error`

So far, you can use INFO, LOG, and ERROR messages with the library.

Get some Github squares by adding more Sam Jackson quotes into the mix. If you are having trouble remembering some of his more memorable lines, take a look at his filmography. The guy has done PLENTY of movies.
